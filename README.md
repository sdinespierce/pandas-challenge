This Jupyter Notebook file contains an analysis of data read from a csv of purchases in a fictional video game. 
It's for an assignment through a Case Western Reserve University bootcamp for data analytics. 

3 insights:
1. The 20-24 age group had by far the largest proportion of players (44.8%) and purchases(46.8%).
2. While females account for ~14% of the player base, they account for ~15% of the total sales, and have higher price/purchase and purchase/person stats than males.
3. No player spent more than $10 on the game or made more than 3 separate purchases. This indicates to me that the company isn't capitalizing on the "whales", or big spenders, in their game, which means there is a large untapped market.
